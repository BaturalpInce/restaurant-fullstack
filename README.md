# Full Stack Website of a Fictional Restaurant
You can check the website anytime at: https://restaurant-fullstack.vercel.app

Made with React, Javascript, Node.js, Express, Firebase, Tailwind CSS, Particlejs and Swiperjs.

# Some of the features
* Includes a menu which fetches all of the data from Firebase.

* Includes autocomplete searchbar with autoscroll on the Menu section.

* Includes a review section with a slider on the Homepage which fetches all the data from Firebase and displays them randomly on each refresh.

* Photo gallery on Homepage.

* Any user can submit their review to my website from the Contact section. I receive all the submitted data on the Firebase Firestore Storage.

* I tried to do the website responsive for mobile and tablet screens.
